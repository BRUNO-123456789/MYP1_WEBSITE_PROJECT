 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Wall-E The Movie</h2>
 <img src="IMG_7877.JPG" alt="Girl in a jacket" height="200">
<pre style="float:right";><b>Plot</b>: In 2105 the level of 
pollution of planet Earth is very high, with the earth's
surface now completely covered with garbage. The Buy n Large
Corporation (BnL), a large trading company that took over the
government of the World, has built a fleet of large spacecraft, 
the flagship of which is the Axiom, on which the whole
of humanity embarked on a five-year cruise in order to 
survive, while on Earth the BnL has built and deployed an
army of robots called "WALL-E" Unfortunately, something is 
not going as it should: for unspecified reasons, the robots 
are all gradually deactivated and in 2110 the return mission 
cannot take place, since the planet has not been cleaned up.
Only one of the robots, however, remains in operation.

 <h2 style="text-align:center;">WALL-E</h2>
 <img src="IMG_7878.JPG" alt="Girl in a jacket" height="200">
<pre style="float:right";> WALL-E: is the protagonist of 
the film, it is similar to a cube provided with two tracks 
moved by three gears each. It is equipped with two cameras 
as eyes, mechanical arms that allow it to grasp objects, 
and a device that allows it to compact waste. At first he 
was a soulless and cold robot, but over the years he 
develops a personality, thanks also to the objects he 
finds and preserves, especially thanks to the cassette of 
the movie Hello, Dolly!, which makes him know love and
makes him dream of finding a partner.

 <h2 style="text-align:center;">EVE</h2>
 <img src="IMG_6345.JPG" alt="Girl in a jacket" height="200">
<pre style="float:right";> EVE: It's a high-tech robot-probe, 
sent to Earth to search for a life form. At first it is cold,
hostile and tends to follow only its directive, not considering 
WALL-E. Later thanks to the robot he will discover a new world,
make friends and fall in love with him, understanding that the
robot would do anything for him; in fact he will change the 
directive to be with him and repair him once he returns to 
earth. When he sees that WALL-E has lost his memory, he will
do anything to make him come back to no avail. Scounded, 
thinking he has lost his love, he gives him a kiss, inadvertently
returning the memory to the robot.

 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Commander B</h2>
 <img src="file_001.png" alt="Girl in a jacket" height="300">
<pre style="float:right";> Commander B. McCrea: He is the captain 
of the ship Axiom. At first he appears quite listless, with the
only concern of announcing the communiqués, as the ship's command 
is left in the hands of its co-pilot/helmshaft AUTO. At the 
announcement of the discovery of the plant he is initially frightened 
by the radical change that will entail returning to Earth, but thanks 
to the involuntary help of WALL-E he remains fascinated by the planet 
(consuming his time researching the Earth on the spaceship's computer) 
and will do everything to return home. AUTO always tries to stop it,
but eventually McCrea will be able to deactivate it by standing up 
even if severely obese (like almost all other humans on the ship), 
and regain manual control of the ship.

<div class="myDiv2">
 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Auto</h2>
 <img src="File_002.png" alt="Girl in a jacket" height="200">
<pre style="float:right";> AUTO: is the main antagonist of 
the film. It is a highly technological, sentimentless and 
very sadistic rudder, scrupulously following its obsolete
directive (A-113), which would be to remain on the Axiom, 
after the BnL had inaccurately concluded that the Earth 
could not be saved. He does everything to be able to 
sabotage humans who are trying to return home. He will 
be stopped by the commander and deactivated. The appearance 
of the character, with the characteristic red "eye", is 
a reference to HAL 9000, the supercomputer of the spacecraft
Discovery One, which appeared in the 2001 film: A Space
Odyssey and in the novel of the same name, also rebellious
against the human crew.</pre>
